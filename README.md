This repository contains code to reproduce results from the paper:

Exploring Transferable Adversarial Attacks for Deep Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection

Still under reviewâ€¦


> - This repository does not yet include the models' training details or the attack algorithms' implementation. If the paper is accepted and published, we commit to releasing all training details and attack algorithm implementations.
> - The results in the papers that can be reproduced now are: Section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, and 5.7. All codes and instructions will be completed before April 20th.
